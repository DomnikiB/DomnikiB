## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Domniki, a Physicist with a passion for Mathematics and Software Development. I am currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Control and Computing at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, exploring the fascinating world of Computer Systems. 

In my coding adventure, I draw inspiration from Open Source Projects and the principles of fair access in the design and maintenance of software products.
